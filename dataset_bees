The honey bee is a social insect, important for agricultural and biomedical research studies.
The honey bee (Apis mellifera) is a valuable organism for study due to its unique behavioral traits and social instincts.
A. mellifera is important to the agricultural community as a pollinator and to researchers as a model for studies in immunity and diseases of the X chromosome. 
These characteristics of the honey bee were instrumental in its assignment as a high priority organism for genome sequencing by the National Human Genome Research Institute
